                                      <p>I am an educator, researcher and GIS enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona in Environmental Studies, and a Master's degree from Northern Arizona University in Sustainable Communities. I specialized water sustainability in desert communities at the U of A and gained an appreciation for how to use computer programs to do GIS mapping. During graduate school I 
                                          specialized in urban planning and water resources. As part of my master's thesis I created alternative water curricular resources for schools and communities. <br>

                                                <p> In 2015 I was invited by Northern Arizona University to participate in the 107th Arizona Town Hall: Keeping Arizona's Water Glass Full. I was a representative of NAU and was able to meet with senators, lawmakers, and other Arizona water stakeholders and present NAU's position. 
                                                    I have also been published in "Sedona Eccentrics World" magazine writing about water conservation. In the summer of 2015 I had the privilege of studying urban planning in Sienna, Italy. It was there that I had the unique opportunity to GIS map Sienna's intircate underground water aqueducts.

                                                        I have worked in schools over the past four years. As part of my teaching I have started two different aquaponics clubs. I helped students plan, build, and maintain aquaponics systems in two different schools.

                                                        Basketball is my first love. I enjoy cooking, swimming, playing ultimate frisbee, and hiking and traveling to different countries with my wife. We enjoy not having kids and spening our money on ourselves.
